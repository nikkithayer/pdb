					<h1><img src="triangle.svg">Clear Roles</h1>
Why is it important?
Understanding your role on a team goes way beyond just knowing what your job is, though that is certainly a part of it. Here are a few key reasons your team needs to get this right:
Understanding your role and how it fits with others will improve psychological safety on the team
Understanding your role and how it fits with others will enable smoother communication
Some roles on a product team, such as the product owner, are crucial to team success. It’s imperative it’s clear to the team who is in those roles. 
How can I improve it?
At the start: 
When you kick off your project, it’s really helpful to include some time for the team to get on the same page about roles. This should happen as a group, but you may also want some 1:1 time. For example, at Carbon Five we will have the Product Manager and the Tech Lead sit down before the project starts to discuss how they see their respective roles and what they would most value from the other person.
During the project:
If you realize part way through a project that roles are not clear, you’ll need to make some time to repair that. It’s important to make some time explicitly to address this topic, rather than just hoping it comes up in your regular retros. We most often see this come up with regard to product ownership, usually because the team made some assumptions that didn’t hold up. For example, a founder may have been the obvious product owner, but actually it turns out that they don’t have time to focus on the product day to day. This can seem like a daunting conversation--you may feel like you’re telling someone they’re not doing their job. But really you’re reiterating what the team needs, and figuring out how best to fill that need. Keeping it focused on the needs of the team and working together to figure out how to meet them can make for a proactive and productive working session.
