		"content": "At the start: When you kick off your project, it’s really helpful to include some time for the team to get on the same page about roles. This should happen as a group, but you may also want some 1:1 time. For example, at Carbon Five we will have the Product Manager and the Tech Lead sit down before the project starts to discuss how they see their respective roles and what they would most value from the other person. During the project: If you realize part way through a project that roles are not clear, you’ll need to make some time to repair that. It’s important to make some time explicitly to address this topic, rather than just hoping it comes up in your regular retros. We most often see this come up with regard to product ownership, usually because the team made some assumptions that didn’t hold up. For example, a founder may have been the obvious product owner, but actually it turns out that they don’t have time to focus on the product day to day. This can seem like a daunting conversation--you may feel like you’re telling someone they’re not doing their job. But really you’re reiterating what the team needs, and figuring out how best to fill that need. Keeping it focused on the needs of the team and working together to figure out how to meet them can make for a proactive and productive working session. ",

		"content": "At the start: Be explicit about your process, or the lack of it. If you’re not subscribing to a process, make sure your team all agrees that’s the case. If you want to introduce a process, define what that means, and have a plan for how you’re going to introduce and (crucially) improve your process. Process, like teams, like people, is never static. During the project: The most important way to address process issues during a project is to have a mechanism for identifying and improving them. We use reflections/retrospectives (more on this below). Whatever your mechanism, if you’re in flight and your process is in trouble, try changing one thing at a time. Imagine you’re a doctor treating a patient: if you change too many variables at once, how will you know which treatment path made them feel better? If you know what’s working, you know what to do more of.",

But don’t leave it there - a presentation can be a great overview, but for people who will be implementing software, you want to dive deeper. An experience map is a great way to get into the nitty gritty of the vision and translate it into terms everyone can share. During the project: Once you’ve kicked off, it’s important to continue to reiterate the vision. If you’re lucky enough to have a project space, make sure you keep artifacts like experience maps and key statements (eg goals, elevator pitches) about the product visible. At every opportunity, tie the work the team is doing back to the vision. Whether it’s signing off an individual story, doing a demo at the end of an iteration, or defining a new feature, it should be clear to the team that this work is in service of a larger vision.",
